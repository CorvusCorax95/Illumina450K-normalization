### FILES:

main: is fitting all single steps together for easy costumization

prepare_data: helpful methods to make data usable

initial plotting: density plots before any normalization

plotting: density plots after normalizations

normalizations: implementation of different normalization approaches


## Step by Step
1. Density Plot of Raw Data
2. Density Plot of logged Data

Organization of my code

src-directory: this can be imported as a module from any other Python program if added to path
__main__.py: now we have a clean execution because python automatically looks for a file named like this
