Processing the data with the betamix-tool is not part of this programme. I
attached the code in the file "betamix-processing" to show how I did it.

1) When entering the bmiq()-Method we get df_beta with the beta_value method
from prepare-data.py.
2) After converting this dataframe to a .csv we split the dataframe into two
files corresponding to one of the two probe types.
3) We give these to the df_to_h5 methods in prepare_data.py
4) For df_to_h5 to function we need to delete a possible old h5 file by hand.
5) We end up with two files (type1_probes.h5 & type2_probes.h5) which have the
needed format to be fed into the betamix tool.
6) betamix-command: python estimate.py -F -t 1E-5 type1-probes.h5 --resultpath
est-snps.h5
7) betamix-command: python evaluate.py -F -i snps -f pdf type1-probes.h5 type1-probes-est.h5 type1-probes-eval.h5
8) After performing the estimation and evaluation step we copy the files we just
 made to the folder betamix-results.
9) In the method bmiq() we pull the parameters and classes from the estimation
file type1_probes_est.h5.
10) now we have everything to perform a beta mixture quantile normalization.
